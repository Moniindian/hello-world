Default Status Codes REST

For the resources exposed, we use a set of default status codes:

200 OK: For plain GET requests.

201 Created: For POST and PUT requests that create new resources.

204 No Content: For PUT, PATCH, and DELETE requests when the configuration is set to not return response bodies for resource updates (RepositoryRestConfiguration.setReturnBodyOnUpdate(…)). If the configuration value is set to include responses for PUT, 200 OK is returned for updates, and 201 Created is returned for resource created through PUT.

If the configuration values (RepositoryRestConfiguration.returnBodyOnUpdate(…) and RepositoryRestConfiguration.returnBodyCreate(…)) are explicitly set to null — which they are by default --, the presence of the HTTP Accept header is used to determine the response code.
